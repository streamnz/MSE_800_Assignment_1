### Background:
You have been hired as a software engineer by a car rental company that wants to automate its rental process. The company currently relies on manual paperwork, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Your task is to design and implement a Car Rental System that will streamline the rental process, improve efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction. Requirements of the Rental System are the following:

---

### Requirements:

#### User Management:
a. Implement user registration and login functionality.  
b. Differentiate between customer and admin roles, each with specific privileges.

#### Car Management:
c. Create a database of available cars, including their details (ID, make, model, year, mileage, available now, minimum rent period, maximum rent period.)  
d. Allow admins to add, update, and delete car records.

#### Rental Booking:
e. Enable customers to view available cars and their details.  
f. Implement a booking feature that allows customers to select a car, specify rental dates, and provide necessary details.  
g. Calculate the rental fees based on the selected car, rental duration, and any additional charges.

#### Rental Management:
h. Allow admins to manage rental bookings, including approving or rejecting requests.
### Assignment Tasks:

#### Task 1: Design and Architecture (LO1)
Design an object-oriented architecture for the car rental system. Consider using appropriate design patterns (such as Factory Method, Singleton, Observer) to enhance modularity and maintainability. Provide a high-level architectural diagram and a description of how each component interacts.

#### Task 2: Innovative Solutions (LO2)
Propose an innovative feature or enhancement that sets your car rental system apart from traditional systems. This could involve integration with modern technologies (such as mobile apps, IoT devices, or cloud services) or introducing a unique user experience. Explain how this innovation addresses a specific industry requirement and provides a competitive advantage.

#### Task 3: Software Evolution (LO2)
Outline a plan for evolving the car rental system over time. Describe how you would handle updates, bug fixes, and new feature additions. Discuss strategies for managing software maintenance, versioning, and backward compatibility. Highlight the importance of software engineering principles in ensuring the system's long-term success.
