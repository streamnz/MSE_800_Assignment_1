# MSE800 Professional Software Engineering

## Intro
This course will expose you to concepts, techniques, and frameworks for designing single and n-tier applications using modern software engineering tools. You will be introduced to the software design process, software life cycle models, requirements engineering, formal specification, and validation. The course will complement the theory and provide in-depth, hands-on experience in key aspects of software engineering.

## Learning Outcomes
**On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:**

- **LO1**: Apply advanced software engineering skills in the context of architectural styles, testing procedures, and the software development lifecycle.
- **LO2**: Analyse how diverse software engineering applications can produce innovative solutions to meet specific industry requirements.
- **LO3**: Implement software engineering principles to develop and evolve software systems in cutting edge industries.
- **LO4**: Evaluate the cultural context for software engineering and the implication for industry management and leadership practice.
- **LO5**: Develop culturally informed teamwork abilities and evaluate their application in software engineering contexts.
- **LO6**: Critically reflect on the software engineering and computing industryâ€™s expectations of professional and cultural competence and conduct.

## Assessments
**You must gain a pass mark (C- or above) for all assessments, in order to pass this course.**

### Grading
All assessments in this programme are graded using the below 11-point grade scale. Specific criteria are outlined for each assessment and the final grade of an assessment will be determined by the mark achieved for each criterion.

### Success Criteria
All requirements of each learning outcome must be met. The success criteria is outlined in each assessment.

### Attempts
For this programme, no more than two assessments can be granted a re-submission/re-sit opportunity across the whole programme. Should additional attempts be permitted for an assessment:
- A maximum of three attempts are permitted, unless special consideration is approved.
- Your overall grade cannot gain advantage beyond 50% OR your original grade.
- A maximum of 50% will be awarded for the resubmitted parts of an assessment.

If your first submission is late, the overall assessment grade will be capped at 50%.

Please see the student handbook and programme policies for full assessment attempt details.
